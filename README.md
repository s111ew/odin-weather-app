# Weather App

As part of [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com) curriculum I created a working weather webapp utilizing the [Visual Crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/) API.

I was able to practice asynchronous prgramming to render weather data from all over the world, including attempting to grab location data from the user.

A live preview of the website is available [here](https://s111ew.github.io/odin-weather-app/).
